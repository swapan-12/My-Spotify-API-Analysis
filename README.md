# My-Spotify-API-Analysis

Spotify maintains a lot of information on its songs internally, which we can get entry to through Spotify API. The Spotify API is a splendid public tool, allowing the use of Spotify’s wealth of statistics on music to construct many sorts of systems. In this project, we learn to use this API through Python’s Spotipy package deal to extract information from unique music identifiers.</b>
 
The Spotify API is quite powerful, and gives us get admission to  a lot of information about any song or artist on Spotify. This ranges from features describing the “feel” of the audio, such as the variables “liveness”, “acousticness”, and “energy”, via to the facets describing the reputation of the artist and song.</b>
 
This project ambitions to manipulate the Spotify song data with Python, having a twofold scope:</b>
​
# For example:
* My spotify playlist insights.</b>
* Music has usually been louder than before.</b>
* What novel kinds of tunes have evolved popular?</b>
​
# Roadmap
 
We make requests to the Spotify API for data collection, using the free Python libraries, Spotify and Requests. We get entry to the user playlists, tracks, and function EDA on their audio features, with the use of Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib. A number of statistics visualizations are depicted, to higher talk the results. Finally, we create the ultimate playlist of tracks.
